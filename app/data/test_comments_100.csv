Excellent. And please don't damage your book on our account, for sure. It is an interesting question: Where was the camera? That's a fair question. To jump to the conclusion that it was """"impossible"""" is ludicrous. But that's typical for the moonbats. The picture is useful for another reason, as it shows a similar relative position of the LEM and the antenna for this Apollo 14 flight as on that web page that argues about those objects in Apollo 12. In both cases, the antenna is at a 45 degree angle away from the LEM, and both the near photo and the distant photo on that website are consistent with each other, despite the website's claims to the contrary. The moonbats isolate on specific items as their """"evidence"""", but the more one sees the broader picture, the more their phony arguments get shown up.  """

0224ce2225ea1fc8,"DECT isn't really a new technology. It's a newer standard, but TDM/TDMA/FDMA digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of DECT. DECT is itself a successor to CT2, Japan's PHS is very similar, and, of course, GSM, D-AMPS, and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half. To suggest there are special health issues with DECT would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject. DECT is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces, both during transmissions, and inherently because even when in use the TD nature of the system means the system isn't transmitting continuously.

As I believe I've said before, there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of low-power radio technology, and there being a link in the See also: section of this article to it. That article, of course, should look nothing like the section I yanked. There is nothing about DECT however that merits a special section on DECT's dangers, especially when - new technology or otherwise - there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue."

Words of Encouragement to user """"Damemk"""" in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda
Damemk, You have come to the same conclusions about Bulgarian 19th Century Nationalistic Propaganda on English Wikipedia.
User:Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not.
He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia.
How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member.
So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda.
Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources.
I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.

I am expecting that this user """"Laveol"""" will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia, simply because he is able to, and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda.
Ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports.

Damemk, I hope you write something here, at least to show that User_talk:Damemk and User_talk:Ejanev is not the same user.    

Some insight into my user name Ejanev
The only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is """"Ejanev"""". It is composed of the first letter of my name """"Emil"""" and my last name """"Janev"""".
User """"Damemk"""" is a separate user. Probably that user name is comming from """"Dame"""" - a Macedonian First name, and """"mk"""" or the code of """"Republic of Macedonia"""".
It does happen that I am from Canada. I was born in Republic of Macedonia and have lived there until I moved to USA first and Canada before more than 3 years.

And yes, having all the false information from the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda ( originating from the 19th century ) and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the Macedonian Nation and all it's attributes by users as """"Laveol"""", is the reason of some of my editing actions in Wikipedia.
I am not the only user/editor from Republic of Macedonia or with Macedonian origin that has the same views for this Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that already is infiltrated in the Macedonian articles.
You can watch the contributions of Special:Contributions/Laveol and see that more than 50% of his actions are engagement in negating the Macedonian Nation and its attributes.

 POV concerns 

Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation

""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""""

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for """"Criticisms of Islam"""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"criticisms of Islam"""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.

Good day.

  

Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where """"treason"""" or """"traitor"""" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   

Changes by Devotus and issues with them

Dear Devotus, 
I have still issues with your changes:
Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from """"each side"""" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.
While your first version was needlessly verbose (""""it is to be noted that""""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.
Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the """"siege and demise"""", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.
Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict. We fought hard and long about words like """"massacre"""" and """"execution"""" and neither should appear unless unavoidable.

 Beauty pageants 

Just because you have no interest in beauty pageants or their contestants doesn't mean that they are not notable - and please don't go trying to delete stuff when you are ignorant about the topic you are dealing with.  I happen to think there are tons of articles on here that do not meet Wikipedia's standards and that do not have individual merit... particularly those about comics etc, but I am wise enough to know that I do not truly understand their significance and so I leave it alone.  A much more prudent avenue would have been to bring your issues to the appropriate WikiProject (WikiProject Beauty Pageants and to address yoru concerns there in the first instance.  One example, the continual use of the term """"model"""" to describe them as has been used by yourself and one other editor, is both incorrect and somewhat demeaning.   """

 On Mohammed Al-Bayati's qualifications 

With regards to the edits over the past day, I think that while Mohammed Al-Bayati's qualifications are tangentially relevant, the purpose of the text as they are placed right now is to """"prove"""" that Mohammed Al-Bayati is not qualified to review the autopsy report.

If the qualifications are to be included they should come under the """"criticism and controversy"""" section, quoted by whoever it is that accused Mohammed Al-Bayati  of not being qualified to review the autopsy report is cited.

 Mediation 

Hello, I am Atyndall and I have volunteered to take on your mediation case, during this discussion I will remain neutral with both sides of this argument and will endeavor to solve your dispute. After having a look at the discussion above, this is what I have found:
QuizzicalBee has been adding the sentence """"According to Chesler, the the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a U.S. citizen."""", Hurmata has been reverting this back to """"She reports that the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country. Hurmata objects to QuizzicalBee's sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed Chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from Chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited. QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid.

0270bbf8002b4476,"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0."
